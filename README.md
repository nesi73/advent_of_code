# Advantage of Code

This project is being developed in **Python** and edited exclusively using **Vim**.  
The motivation behind this approach is twofold: to improve my Python programming skills while mastering Vim as a development tool.

Vim, with its lightweight design and powerful features, encourages a highly efficient workflow once you overcome the initial learning curve. By using Vim, I aim to:

- **Enhance my productivity** by leveraging its modal editing and customizability.  
- **Minimize distractions**, focusing entirely on the code rather than relying on feature-heavy IDEs.  
- **Deepen my understanding** of the terminal-based tools that are fundamental in many professional environments.

This journey is as much about code as it is about learning how to work smarter with tools that demand precision and intentionality.  

Feel free to share any tips or suggestions for improving either my Python code or my use of Vim!
